description: Write dialogue and use commands for portraits, names, layouts, sounds, and timing.

To show dialogue in PS Maker, use the **Dialogue** action.

When you add this action, you will see a large text box. This is where you write the dialogue that appears in the in-game dialogue box.

## Page breaks

The dialogue box paginates when there are empty lines between blocks of text. Each block appears as a separate dialogue page.

For example:

```txt
Hello, this is on the first dialogue page.

With the empty line above, this part displays on the next page.
```

:::note
Use the dialogue preview button to preview how the dialogue box will render your text in game!

## Line breaks

Text blocks that have one newline inbetween will render as a linebreak in the dialogue box.

```txt
Hello, this is the first dialogue line.
This line will render right below, on the same page.
```

Any commands will negate this and the text will render as if it were the same line.

```txt
These two lines are the same. One just waits 1 second.

These two lines are the same.
@wait 1000
One just waits 1 second.
```

Add a `@line_break` to bring the line break back.

```txt
Hello, this is the first dialogue line.
@wait 120
@line_break
This line will render right below, on the same page.
```

## Commands

Beside regular dialogue text, you can add commands to change how the dialogue behaves.

Commands must start on a new line and always begin with an `@` character.

A command can take multiple options. Options are separated by spaces.

Some commands you can use:

- `@portrait`
- `@dialogue_layout`
- `@wait`
- `@line_break`
- `@no_page_break`
- `@wait`

## Running Actions Within Dialogue

It’s possible to control the world behind a dialogue box by running actions using the @run_action command. This is useful for things like a cutscene where the player and NPC move while dialogue is playing. Another example adjusting the camera position to show something relevant to dialogue.

Running actions within dialogue works similarly to other commands. Type @ to select the run action command, then select the action to run, and finally configure what the action does.

```
  @run_action show_image
  It's an image in the middle of the screen.
```

## Showing a Name Box

To show a name in your dialogue, start the line with `Name:`.

Any characters before the `:` symbol will be rendered in the dialogue box as the name.

```txt
Alex: Hello there!
```

The name UI must be enabled in the dialogue layout. You can change this in the project assets.

## Showing Portraits

Use the `@portrait` command to show a portrait.

Use `@portrait none` to remove any portrait that is currently being shown.

```
@portrait alice neutral
@wait 500
Alice: Hey there.

@portrait alice happy
Alice: I'm glad you came.

@portrait none
@wait 1000
The room falls silent.
```

The portrait UI must also be enabled in the dialogue layout. You can change this in the project assets.
